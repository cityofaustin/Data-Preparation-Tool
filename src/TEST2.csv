While I have never endorsed closing this Greenbelt entrance, I’m disappointed in the City’s ability to open additional entrances to the Greenbelt, given the safety concerns around the traffic off of the Mopac entrance and in our neighborhood. I don’t blame many of the Greenbelt visitors; the city has not offered too many local alternatives, when it was made clear by the City decades ago that the area across from Rudy’s was an acceptable access point where parking and facilities could be installed. The amount of time I see safety vehicle lights coming through my neighborhood or see our beautiful yards being filled with trash or dog poop does a disservice to our neighborhood residents that pay incredibly high taxes. Given the increase of city revenue, there’s never been a more optimal time to expand access points to trails such as the Greenbelt behind our neighborhood. The parking would not be an issue if visitors had other non-residential places to go. When we moved to this neighborhood, we understood that we took on the risk of living near a public entrance on public streets. Yet, we opted not to live downtown with high traffic so our kids may bike the neighborhood. Because of the city’s failure to yet make good on their promise of adding the other access points off of 360, I don’t feel comfortable with my children participating in the simple American childhood past time, riding bikes. I’m not sure how lack of funds could possibly be the reason behind not making an extra access point acceptable. This is not just about pleasing our small neighborhood. It’s about making access to nature safer with bathrooms, water, and a more safe entrance than the steep hill that many currently get injured.
Because now more than ever, we don’t feel comfortable with our kids riding their bikes (a consequence of the higher traffic than ever resulting from COVID-19 and Lost Creek requiring payment at their access point), it would make sense to add a childhood playground for our children to access. The meadows next to 360 provided ample space where our kids walk the dog and get away from the traffic. I highly encourage a childhood park be built there for the three neighborhoods next to Lost Creek have an accessible, safe area for children to gather and play.
Lastly, if the traffic continues, the parking pilot in our neighborhood, in my opinion was unsuccessful. We are not located downtown and there is ample parking in our neighborhood if we have guests over, especially on week days. We should not have to worry about our guests being ticketed. There should be a database of license plates we can add that are okay to park. The “free” guest codes required payment or deposits to park. We were only given 2 signs to hang on the car mirror. If this continues, there needs to be a way for residents to be less conveniences when they have people over, and the money being brought into the city should allow a park employee to walk our neighborhood and the trail to pick up trash and dog poop. Many visitors unfortunately don’t respect nature and people’s homes, so there’s no question that the additional parking revenue should be used to restore these areas after high traffic.",8,,
